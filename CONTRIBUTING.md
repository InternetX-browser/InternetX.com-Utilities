# Contributing

Hello, developer. See that you wants to be a contributor no? :bowtie:

## Rules

1. Don't make the things that no have the "Utility" things.
- If you make other that this you can be quited from the contributor list.
2. See the other person ideas
- You need to see other person ideas, this is good. With this you can make to the other person good!
3. Make the Utilities on the search pages.
- For example: If you make a utility on the Home page, you can be quited from the contributor list. But if you make a paint when search `paint`, `Paint`, `Paint Brush` or `Paint Images` it's all good.
4. Import all to the React :atom: site.
- If you imports the utility to other repository or not in the React :atom: site, you can be quited from the contributor list.

## We nice to meet you contributing!

For be a contributor you need to make a thing from the rule on the repository and make with it a Pull Request. But you need to make 10 good things from the rules. But not hack. :shipit:
